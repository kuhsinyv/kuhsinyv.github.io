### Hi there!

+ 🎒 I am an undergraduate student in Nanchang University (majoring in computer science, grade 2019).
+ 💻 I'm working on some private projects for my school.
+ 👬 I'm working on Internet projects with friends in a cozy "family" [@NCUHOME 🏠](https://github.com/ncuhome)!
+ 📚 I'm learning about WEB backend development and part of the DevOps.
